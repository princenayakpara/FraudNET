# 🚀 AutoSense PC Manager - ElectroSphere 2K26 Edition

> **"Not just a cleaner, but an Intelligent System Health Guardian."**

---

## 🌟 Project Vision (The "Idea")
AutoSense is a Next-Generation PC Management solution designed to solve the problem of "Passive Maintenance." Traditional cleaners only act when you tell them to. **AutoSense uses AI to predict system degradation before it happens.**

By combining real-time monitoring with Machine Learning (Isolation Forest Anomaly Detection), AutoSense moves from *Reactive* repairs to *Proactive* optimization.

---

## 💡 Innovation & Creativity
We moved beyond simple `if-else` scripts.
- **Hybrid AI Engine**: Combines rule-based heuristics (for immediate threats) with an **Unsupervised Learning Model (Isolation Forest)** to detect subtle system anomalies that static rules miss.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: The system learns your usage patterns and frees up resources seamlessly.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: A modern, fluid interface that enables complex data visualization without overwhelming the user.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Strategy (The "Hardware/Software Selection")
We chose a **Lightweight & Powerful** stack to ensure the manager itself doesn't become bloatware.

| Component | Choice | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | **Python (FastAPI)** | High performance, async capabilities, and native support for AI/ML libraries (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`). |
| **AI Model** | **Isolation Forest** | Perfect for anomaly detection in time-series data (CPU/RAM usage) without needing massive labeled datasets. |
| **Frontend** | **Vanilla JS + CSS3** | Zero-dependency approach ensures 100% control over rendering performance and ultra-low memory footprint. |
| **System** | **Windows API (winreg)** | Direct Deep-Level access to system registry for true optimization, not just cosmetic changes. |

---

## 🔮 Future Scalability
- **Cloud Sync**: Train models on multiple machines to create a "Fleet Health" capability.
- **Auto-Healing**: Scripts that can download and reinstall corrupted drivers automatically.
- **Voice Control**: Integration with Cortana/Voice assistants for hands-free optimization.

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in any modern web browser.
